                With animation, anything goes. Filmmakers are not bound by the physical laws of the Earth, so their characters can do incredible things. Actually, they're not bound by Earth at all, so animated films can take audiences to worlds that can only be imagined. And, as technology catches up to artistic ambition, animated movies are only getting easier to make, and more plentiful. Really, the sky's the limit.
